ideas:
-poisonous pellets that also randomly generate like the food, except they would result in a game over

-different difficulties with different speeds

-extra hard mode: increased speed, increased poisonous pellet production

-high score counting method

-different difficulties are named different types of snakes, with cobra being the most difficult
    -different difficulty buttons will have different colors for better UI (green is easy, yellow is medium, red is hard)

-timed mode, what's the highest score you can get in one minute
    -show timer
